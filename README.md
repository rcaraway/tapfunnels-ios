# TapFunnels
Tapfunnels is an iOS experimentation framework that helps you grow your app's revenue and userbase. 


*Tapfunnels is a work in progress.*

## TapFunnels does all the things an experienced, disciplined mobile product manager should do: 
- Running one experiment per screen at a time
- A/B testing is not enough -- rolls out to just enough users
- gathers and compares data against each screen's KPI
- If an experiment improves KPIs, the experiment will automatically rollout to the remaining users.
- If not, it will stop showing the experiment.
- Once complete, the next experiment in the queue will begin immediately.

This means the only thing you need to focus on is which experiments to run.
